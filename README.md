# JQuery
Task within Kodilla bootcamp. The aim was to use jQuery in my project for the first time. 
There were 2 Tasks - a new branch on each was created. 
Branch Task1 - using the possibilities of jQuery on a simple HTML code (creating new elements, changing css styles, adding event handlers).
Branch Task2 - creating own carousel like the Bootstrap one using jQuery (image change every 3 seconds, the circle indicators show which image is currently being displayed, indicators can be clicked to jump to desired image, there are also arrows: left and right which enable jumping to the next or previous image).
